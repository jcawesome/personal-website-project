# Personal Portfolio Project

This project focuses on building a personal website using the tools &amp; techniques covered in the Jovian Full Stack Developer course specifically HTML/CSS & JavaScript.

## Guidelines

    - Check out the Figma community or Dribble to find a good design you can implement
    - The website should contain at least two pages (e.g. "Home" & "Contact")
    - The home page should have at least 4 sections (e.g. Hero, About, Projects/Career, Footer)
    - The website should contain at least one form (e.g. on the contact page)
    - Start by first creating a wireframe using Excalidraw and then implement the page
    - The website must be responsive and easily viewable on mobile, tablet, and desktop
    - You can use the Bootstrap or any other CSS framework to build the website
    - Use https://formbold.com or set up a Express server to collect form responses
    - Use consistent & aesthetically pleasing colors, fonts, and design elements
    - You need not replicate a design exactly, just try to make your site look good
    - The website should be deployed to Vercel & you can optionally connect a custom domain
    - All the information on the website should be true & accurate (so you can link it from your Resume)

## Project Website Design Inspiration

Inspirtation for this website comes from the Web Designer Dliya' Zarror Nibros "@dzarrorn" from the Figma Community for designing such a simple and elegant 'Personal Portfolio Website'
