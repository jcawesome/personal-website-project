# Personal Portfolio Project

This project focuses on building a personal website using the tools &amp; techniques covered in the Jovian Full Stack Developer course specifically HTML/CSS & JavaScript.

## Guidelines

* Check out the Figma community or Dribble to find a good design you can implement
* The website should contain at least two pages (e.g. "Home" & "Contact")
* The home page should have at least 4 sections (e.g. Hero, About, Projects/Career, Footer)
* The website should contain at least one form (e.g. on the contact page)
* Start by first creating a wireframe using Excalidraw and then implement the page
* The website must be responsive and easily viewable on mobile, tablet, and desktop
* You can use the Bootstrap or any other CSS framework to build the website
* Use https://formbold.com or set up a Express server to collect form responses
* Use consistent & aesthetically pleasing colors, fonts, and design elements
* You need not replicate a design exactly, just try to make your site look good
* The website should be deployed to Vercel & you can optionally connect a custom domain
* All the information on the website should be true & accurate (so you can link it from your Resume)

## Project Website Design Inspiration

Inspirtation for this website comes from the Web Designer Dliya' Zarror Nibros "@dzarrorn" from the Figma Community for designing simple and elegant 'Personal Portfolio Websites'

I planned to take some elements from both the designs to fit my own personal portfolio
